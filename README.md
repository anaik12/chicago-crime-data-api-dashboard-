# Getting Started with React + D3 Workshop

In this project we will use React and d3 concepts to create an interactive visualization application. We will be creating a simple interactive dashboard for Crimes in Chicago.

Assuming you have git, vscode and node installed, open a terminal in vscode and run the following in a project directory of your choice.

In the project directory, you can run:
```
$git clone https://github.com/anaik12/chicago-crime-dashboard.git

$cd chicago-crime-dashboard

$`yarn install` 

$`yarn start`

```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Data 

The data was obtained from from Chicago Data Portal for Crimes in Chicago. This dataset has Chicago from 2001 - Present.

For the sake of this project a small subset of dataset between Jan 2020 - Feb 2025 is being used.
